                <p>Hulagu and his forces were proceeding towards Damascus, where some of the Syrian emirs suggested to an-Nasir Yusuf to surrender and submit to Hulagu as the best solution to save themselves and Syria. The Mamluk Baibars, who was present
                    at the meeting, was upset by the suggestion,[h] and the Mamluks decided to kill an-Nasir Yusuf that night. However, he managed to escape with his brother to the citadel of Damascus. Baibars and the Mamluks then left Syria, travelling
                    to Egypt where they were warmly welcomed by Sultan Qutuz, who granted Baibars the town of Qalyub.[i][17][16] When an-Nasir Yusuf heard that the Mongol army was approaching Aleppo, he sent his wife, his son and his money to Egypt. The
                    population of Damascus and other Syrian towns began to flee.</p>
